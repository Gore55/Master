Shoulder rotation estimation and prediction

The objective of this code is to check the posibility of estimating the roation of the shoulder joint using neural networks and EMG sensors and
then predict the rotation after half a second.

This is my master's thesis. I did this for a university development team working on a flexible exoskeleton for shoulder
injury rehabilitation. The rotation we try to estimate and predict is always inside a presert sequence of movements.

The estimation is not actually working due to failure on the data acquisition but prediction works fine.
